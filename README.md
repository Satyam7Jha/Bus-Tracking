## _ABOUT_
It's a basic app taking **React Native** as a base for writing code and **Expo** as a platform for execution of the aim of the project that is to **track the live location** for the logged in users. In this project, the users will come across an **Interactive Interface** wherein they will find the location with **Optimal User Guidance** provided by the host members. Herein all the data and information of the users are stored within a safe and secure **Realtime Database** known to be **Google Firebase**. Wherein every information of the individual user is given a **unique credentials** to avoid overlapping.Here in the users just have to **sign in** and fill all the information which  then on verification will be considered as a separate individual enjoying the app interface and its features.
